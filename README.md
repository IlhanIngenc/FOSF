# FOSF
Flexible Optimization Solution Framework (FOSF)

The Flexible Optimization Solution Framework (FOSF) is a versatile platform for solving linear optimization problems. It supports multiple optimization methods (e.g., Simplex, Highs, Interior-Point) and allows users to dynamically set their objective functions, constraints, and resource limits. Ideal for various applications, FOSF simulates optimization scenarios and stores results in a JSON file, providing a flexible, user-friendly solution for developers.
